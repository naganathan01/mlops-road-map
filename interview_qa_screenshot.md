### **4. What are your weaknesses?**

**Professional Weakness with Growth Mindset:**

"I used to struggle with over-engineering solutions - spending too much time optimizing systems beyond what was actually needed for the business requirements. My technical background made me want to build the 'perfect' system rather than the 'right' system.

**How I've Addressed This:**
I've learned to adopt a more business-focused approach by:

**Time-Boxing Optimization:**
I now set specific time limits for optimization tasks and ask 'What's the minimum viable solution that meets our requirements?' before starting any optimization work.

**Business Impact Focus:**
I regularly check with stakeholders to ensure my technical decisions align with business priorities. I've learned that a system that delivers 90% accuracy in one month is often better than a system that delivers 95% accuracy in six months.

**Iterative Development:**
I now follow an iterative approach - build something that works well, deploy it, gather feedback, then improve. This has helped me deliver value faster while still maintaining high quality standards.

**Real Example:**
In my current role, I initially wanted to build a complex ensemble model with extensive hyperparameter tuning. Instead, I deployed a simpler XGBoost model first, which met business requirements and delivered immediate value. We then improved it iteratively based on production feedback.

**Ongoing Growth:**
I continue to work on balancing technical excellence with business pragmatism by regularly seeking feedback from both technical and business stakeholders. This weakness has actually become a strength as it's taught me to be more strategic about where to invest technical effort."
