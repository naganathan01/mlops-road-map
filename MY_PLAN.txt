üìà Strategic Learning Plan for High Pay
Phase 1: Core MLOps (Month 1-2)
Focus: 15 core technologies, not all 43
Priority Technologies:
1. Python (pandas, scikit-learn, FastAPI)
2. Docker (Dockerfile, optimization)
3. Kubernetes (Deployments, Services, monitoring)
4. MLflow (Model Registry, tracking)
5. AWS SageMaker (training, endpoints)
Phase 2: Production Projects (Month 3-4)
Focus: Build 2-3 portfolio projects
Project 1: End-to-end ML pipeline
Project 2: Real-time model serving
Project 3: ML monitoring system
Phase 3: Advanced Topics (Month 5-6)
Focus: Performance, scale, and business impact
- Model optimization
- A/B testing
- Cost optimization
- Security best practices
üéØ Interview Success Strategy
Your Winning Narrative:
"I'm a DevOps engineer with 4+ years of production experience who strategically learned MLOps. While most MLOps candidates struggle with production deployment,
I already know how to build reliable, scalable systems. I've applied this expertise to build ML systems that actually work in production."
Key Talking Points:

Infrastructure Expertise: "I understand production challenges most ML engineers don't"
Learning Agility: "I rapidly mastered MLOps concepts in 6 months"
Business Impact: "My projects show measurable ROI, not just technical demos"
Reliability Focus: "I build ML systems that achieve 99.9% uptime"

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid
‚ùå Don't Do This:

Learn all 43 technologies superficially
Focus on quantity over quality
Skip building real projects
Ignore business impact metrics
Apply only to senior roles immediately

‚úÖ Do This Instead:

Master 15-20 core technologies deeply
Build 3-4 production-quality projects
Document everything with metrics
Start with realistic salary expectations
Leverage your DevOps experience

üöÄ High-Pay Job Strategy
Month 1-3: Foundation + Projects

Learn core 15 technologies
Build first production project
Start applying to ‚Çπ22-28 lakh roles

Month 4-6: Portfolio + Experience

Complete 3 portfolio projects
Apply to ‚Çπ25-32 lakh roles
Network with MLOps professionals

Month 7-12: Expertise + Growth

Gain production experience
Target ‚Çπ32-40+ lakh roles
Consider senior positions

üí° Bottom Line
Learning all 43 technologies alone won't get you high pay.
What will get you high pay:

Your existing 4+ years DevOps experience (huge advantage)
Strategic learning of 15-20 core MLOps technologies
3-4 portfolio projects with business impact
Strong interview performance leveraging your experience

Realistic expectation: With focused 6-month learning + your background, you should target ‚Çπ25-35 lakhs initially, growing to ‚Çπ35-50 lakhs within 12-18 months.
Your DevOps background is your secret weapon - use it strategically! üéØ
