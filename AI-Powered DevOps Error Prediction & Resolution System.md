MLOps Future Error Prediction System
Project Overview
An MLOps pipeline that predicts potential errors and failures in development/DevOps environments before they occur, enabling proactive issue resolution and system optimization.
Problem Statement
Development and DevOps teams face recurring challenges with system failures, deployment issues, and infrastructure problems that could be prevented if predicted in advance. This system analyzes historical patterns, system metrics, and environmental factors to forecast potential issues.
Features

Error Pattern Recognition: Analyze historical logs and error patterns
